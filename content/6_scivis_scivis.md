We will study 3D scientific visualization with ParaView, an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization
tool designed to run on a variety of hardware from an individual laptop to large supercomputers. With ParaView users can
interactively visualize 2D and 3D data sets defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes or particles,
animate these datasets in time, and manipulate them with a variety of filters. ParaView supports both interactive (GUI)
and scripted (including offscreen) visualization, and is an easy and fun tool to learn.

**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (SFU)

**Prerequisites**: This is an introductory course, no prior visualization experience is required.

**Software**: Please [install ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download) on your computer, and make sure you
can start it before the course. As of this writing, the latest ParaView version is 5.10.1 -- it should work
nicely for our workshop. We will provide all sample data and codes for the exercises. Let us know before or
during the course if you want to load your own dataset into ParaView.
